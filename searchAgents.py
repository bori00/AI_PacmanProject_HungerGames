This file contains all of the agents that can be selected to control Pacman.  To
select an agent, use the '-p' option when running pacman.py.  Arguments can be
passed to your agent using '-a'.  For example, to load a SearchAgent that uses
depth first search (dfs), run the following command:

> python pacman.py -p SearchAgent -a fn=depthFirstSearch

    """
    A heuristic for the HungerGamesSearchProblem, based on the following idea:
    - any path from the current state to the goal takes at least manhattan distance steps
    - if there is a path from the current position to the maze exit position,
    such that the manhattan distance <= current energy level + energy level gained from food dots on the path,
    then it's possible, that a path satisfying all problem constraints with cost manhattan distance exists
    - if there is no such path, then PacMan must step at least once in the "wrong direction".
    By wrong direction we mean that for obtaining a path with manhattan distance cost,
    if the maze exit is to the South from PacMan's position, then any step to the North is wrong and vice-versa.
    Similarly, if the exit is to the East from PacMan's position, then any step to the West is wrong, and vice-versa.
    Moreover, if PacMan takes one step to any wrong direction, than that step must be "recovered" later,
    i.e. annulled with a backwards step.
    Thus, we can guarantee that if no path with manhattan distance cost exists,
    then any path has the cost >= manhattan distance + 2.

    Note that this heuristic takes into account only the energy level required for the entire path to the goal,
    but does not verify whether there is enough energy at all steps of the path.

    To verify whether a path with the above characteristics exists, a dynamic programming approach is used,
    based on the formula

    the correct directions).
    Returns a matrix with the values for all (x, y) locations (of the same size as food_grid).

    If a location (x0, y0) is not reachable according to the rules of HungerGames, with only steps into the correct
    directions, then -1 is placed on the given location.

    Note: the "leaving energy" is computed, not the "reaching energy", meaning that the energy given by the potential
    doos dot on psotion (x, y) is added to the value computed for location (x, y).

    For the computations, a dynamic programming algorithm is used, based on the formula
    max energy on (x, y) = max(max energy on (x-1, y), max energy on (x, y-1)) +

    To implement this verification, additionally to the methods in

    For this
    - the maximum possible energy level of PacMan was computed when leaving the position (x, y), assuming that PacMan
    reaches (x, y) through a path with steps only into a correct direction, from its current position.
    See buildMaxEnergyLevelGrid.
